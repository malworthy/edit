A half complete text editor for DOS.
Written in Borland Turbo C.

There is not much of need for a DOS text editor in 2022, but I suppose I'm still working on this after a break of 21 years just to see if I can do it.
Writing a fully functionaly text editor is actuallly very difficult, especially using a version of C from the 1980's.

To Compile:

- install a DOS emulator (DOSBOX is what I use)
- install Borland Turbo C Version 2.01 
- then run MAKE
